jQuery pageState is a jQuery plugin that stores the state of form inputs
behind an anchor hash in the URL, and makes an AJAX call for more data
whenever those inputs change. 

This is mean to enable a kind of progressive
enhancement of data visualizations that rely on forms submission to control
the state of the vis. So if you have a table of records that can be filtered
or sorted by submitting a form, this plugin would bind all the form inputs so
that changing them would 

  a) update the state of the URL, and 
  b) request data with the updated parameters from some AJAX endpoint.
